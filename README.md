# ml-pipeline
The aim is to build a machine learning pipeline capturing various stages in an ml project. This repository contains code for 4 different ml 
stages along with a code for pipeline written using scikit-learn package in Python. They are:
1. Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Feature Selection
4. Machine learning model building
5. Creating pipeline
The first task is to build a machine learning model to predict the sale price of homes based on different explanatory variables describing aspects of residential houses.
